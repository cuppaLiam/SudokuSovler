# Sudoku Solver
As an extension to the Suguru solver which can be found at:
https://github.com/cuppaLiam/SuguruSolver
I decided to make a sudoku solver, as in theory it should be able to work in the same way.
I would recommend go checking out the suguru solver instead if you haven't already, as it is a way more polished program despite the flaws it still has. The algorithm implemented here is the same conceptually, but altered for a Sudoku instead and made in C instead.
Ideally it would've worked perfectly, providing a more efficient (due to being written in C), more mainstream application of the algorithm which would serve as extra evidence for some claims made in the suguru solver's time complexity analysis. 
Unfortunately the sudoku puzzle has too many possibilities for ways it can be setup and therefore solved, but in principle it does still serve as a working program which can be used on most sodokus out there, in a more efficient manner than backtracking but will fail on complicated occasions.
Would like to return to this one day too and summarise this project into something more whole.
